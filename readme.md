# simplest-typescript-webpack-boilerplate

I didn't want complicated. This is just enough boilerplate to get moving with
writing Typescript for use in the browser.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/ianks/simplest-typescript-webpack-boilerplate
cd simplest-typescript-webpack-boilerplate
npm i
npm start
```
